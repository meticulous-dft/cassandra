# About this Repo

This is an extended version of the [official Docker Cassandra](https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra/) image for added support for [rancher](http://rancher.com/).

If run on rancher and setting the environment variable ```RANCHER_ENABLE=true```, it will need no further configuration and can be run in a service.

Original [code](https://github.com/techtraits/docker-rancher-cassandra). Detailed [explanation](http://rancher.com/running-cassandra-on-rancher/).
